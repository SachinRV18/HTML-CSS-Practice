HTML: Hypertext Markup Language
    We use HTML to structure the content on a webpage.
    The file extension is .html.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
    We use CSS to style our website for better visibility.
    The file extension is .css.

    Note: index.html [Default homepage file name]
    When we navigate to a website, for example, xyz.com, the browser looks in the root directory for an index.html file. If it exists, the browser serves it.

HTML Tags:
    1. DOCTYPE
        This defines the document as an HTML5 document and tells the browser to render it correctly.
        Syntax: <!DOCTYPE html>
        This is the only tag that starts with an exclamation mark (< : angle bracket).

    2. html tag
        Syntax: <html>...........</html>
        This is the root tag for an HTML document.

    3. head tag
        Syntax: <head>...........</head>
        It contains additional information about the website, like metadata or a title that appears at the top of the browser.
        Note: It doesn't render anything in the browser.

    4. body tag
        Syntax: <body>...........</body>
        It renders the content in the browser.

Running HTML Code:
1. File Protocol
    This opens the file and contains the full path of the file in the URL.

2. Local Development Server
    It helps to view the website using the HTTP protocol.

3. HTTP Protocol:
    HTTP is the protocol used to communicate with servers to view websites.

    The main advantage of using a Local Development Server is that we don't need to reload the page each time, which saves time.
    For example, 127.0.0.1 is the local host.

4. Inspect
    Inspect helps preview the HTML file in a browser.
    It is also called the Google Chrome Developer Tools panel.
