HTML: Hypertext Markup Language
    We use HTML to structure the content on a webpage.
    The file extension is .html.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
    We use CSS to style our website for better visibility.
    The file extension is .css.

    Note: index.html [Default homepage file name]
    When we navigate to a website, for example, xyz.com, the browser looks in the root directory for an index.html file. If it exists, the browser serves it.

HTML Tags:
    1. DOCTYPE
        This defines the document as an HTML5 document and tells the browser to render it correctly.
        Syntax: <!DOCTYPE html>
        This is the only tag that starts with an exclamation mark (< : angle bracket).

    2. html tag
        Syntax: <html>...........</html>
        This is the root tag for an HTML document.

    3. head tag
        Syntax: <head>...........</head>
        It contains additional information about the website, like metadata or a title that appears at the top of the browser.
        Note: It doesn't render anything in the browser.

    4. body tag
        Syntax: <body>...........</body>
        It renders the content in the browser.

Running HTML Code:
1. File Protocol
    This opens the file and contains the full path of the file in the URL.

2. Local Development Server
    It helps to view the website using the HTTP protocol.

3. HTTP Protocol:
    HTTP is the protocol used to communicate with servers to view websites.

    The main advantage of using a Local Development Server is that we don't need to reload the page each time, which saves time.
    For example, 127.0.0.1 is the local host.

4. Inspect
    Inspect helps preview the HTML file in a browser.
    It is also called the Google Chrome Developer Tools panel.

Basic Elements in HTML (with content)

1. Paragraph tag (<p>):
   Used to add a paragraph of text.

2. Strong tag (<strong>):
   Makes text important or bold.

3. Em tag (<em>):
   Used to emphasize text.

4. Small tag (<small>):
   Makes the text smaller.

5. Heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>):
   The larger the number, the less important the heading.
   - <h1> is the most important heading tag.
   - <h6> is the least important heading tag.

6. Unordered list (<ul>):
   Contains list items (<li>) as nested tags.
   Used for a bulleted list.

7. Ordered list (<ol>):
   Contains list items (<li>) as nested tags.
   Used for a numbered list.

8. Division tag (<div>):
   Used to group together HTML elements into a single container.

9. Span tag (<span>):
   The <span> tag is an inline container used to group a small portion of text or elements.
   It is often used to apply styles or functionality to a specific part of the content.


Hook: A "hook" is a target in HTML where we can attach CSS styles or JavaScript functionality.
Example: <span class="highlight">


Some Elements with Only One Tag (No Content)

1. Line Break (<br>):
   Adds a line break.

2. Horizontal Rule (<hr>):
   Creates a horizontal line.

3. Image tag (<img>):
   Used to display an image.

Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about an element.
Example: <img src=".....path.....">
- Absolute Path: When the file is not placed in the root folder, we use an absolute path.
  Example: image/file1.jpg

  Note: If using a local server, add a forward slash (/) to represent the root of the project.
  Example: /image/file1.jpg

- Relative Path: Specifies the file location relative to the current folder.
- Alt Attribute: Provides a text description of the image (for accessibility or when the image fails to load).

Anchor tag (<a>)
The anchor tag is used to create links or navigate to other pages within a website.
- The href attribute is used to specify the URL or target page.
  Example: <a href="about.html">This is the About page</a>

Blockquote tag (<blockquote>)

The <blockquote> tag is used to define a block of text that is a quotation from another source.
- The cite attribute is used to reference the source of the quotation.
  Example:
  <blockquote cite="https://www.example.com">
    This contains a link to the external page.
  </blockquote>

Style Attribute: The style attribute is used to apply CSS styles directly to HTML elements.
Example: <p style="color: red;">Style me :)</p>

Comments: HTML comments are used to make the code more readable and to add notes for developers.
Example: <!-- This is a comment -->
